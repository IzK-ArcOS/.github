# 👋 Welcome to ArcOS!

</div>

ArcOS is the advanced Svelte-based Operating System Environment in your browser. With ArcOS we aim to create the best possible experience we can within the confines of your browser. ArcOS consists of:
- 📊 Advanced process and service management,
- ☁ Readymade cloud storage to access your account from anywhere using ArcOS' [ArcAPI](https://github.com/IzK-ArcOS/ReArc-Backend) 🔒 (WIP),
- 🔐 A secure user system consisting of hashed and salted passwords,
- 🗄 Filesystem integration to store, create and upload files,
- ~~📧 A built-in messaging system to talk to other ArcOS users on the same server,~~
- ✨ Endless customization options to really adjust ArcOS to your personal taste,
- 🐣 Beginner-friendly User Interface without the need of manuals,
- ~~🧾 Inclusive Help & Support center to read up on things you don't immediately understand,~~
- ⚠ Powerful error reporting and crash logs so that we can fix anything that's wrong as fast as possible

## 🛠 Getting started
It's currently not possible to run ArcOS for yourself. Sounds weird doesn't it? You see all of this amazing stuff and you can't try it out yourself? Outrageous! Actually, before storming the castle, we're redesigning ArcOS from the ground up as ArcOS v7, which is why all infrastructure has been taken down and ArcOS can't be accessed by our users right now. ArcOS v7 is probably done around June of 2025, optimistically speaking.

## Disclaimers
- ArcOS cannot be used as a primary operating system. An attempt to do so is discouraged.
- This is not an actual operating system. It is an environment that runs on top of your already existing OS, built using web technologies. It isn't possible to install already existing applications from third parties. This functionality may be implemented in the distant future.
- All assets in ArcOS, including those created by the team, belong to their respective owners. Reuse without credit is not permitted.
- The ArcOS team is not responsible for loss of data when using ArcAPI. Do not store sensitive info on the File System. ArcAPI passwords are hashed and salted.
