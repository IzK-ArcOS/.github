- 🔐 A secure user system consisting of hashed and salted passwords,
- 🗄 Filesystem integration to store, create and upload files,
- 📧 A built-in messaging system to talk to other ArcOS users on the same server,
- ✨ Endless customization options to really adjust ArcOS to your personal taste,
- 🐣 Beginner-friendly User Interface without the need of manuals,
- ⚠ Powerful error reporting and crash logs so that we can fix anything that's wrong as fast as possible
